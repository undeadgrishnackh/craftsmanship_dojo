# ü•ã The Software Craftsmanship Dojo üèõÔ∏è

This project is a continuous learning platform for developers. It's based on my interpretation of the coding Dojo model and the SW Craftsmanship manifesto principles and values. My implementation of the dojo is based on my 40+ years of experience as a martial art student and instructor. An experience heavily impacted by coaching for performance, neuroscience and behavioural psychology. The platform intends to upskill developers towards craftsmanship, good SW development behaviors, proudness and happiness in what they do.

## The dojo model

The model of the dojo is based on levels of expertise (4 clusters) and mastery (9 belts based on the Judo ranking):

- initiate: white, yellow and orange belts
- intermediate: green, and blue belts
- expert: brown and black belts
- coach: red/white and red belts

Every belt has a learning program based on four pillars:

- eXtreme Programming to foster coding craftsmanship: TDD, ATDD, BDD, DDD, Clean Code, Clean Architecture
- Lean Product Management: TDD/ATDD UaT, BDD Gherkin, LeanUX, DDD/Event Storming
- DevOps: Continuous * (build, test, integration, deployment, delivery), IaC (containerization from local to K8s)
- SRE Posture: Continuous Security, Chaos Engineering, Monitoring/Observability.
